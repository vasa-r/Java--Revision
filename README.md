# Java Revision Repository

Welcome to my Java revision repository! After a break of around two years, I am diving back into Java programming to brush up on core concepts, algorithms, and data structures. This repository will contain various Java exercises and examples as I revisit the fundamentals and explore more advanced topics.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax**: Revisiting Java's basic structure, syntax, and object-oriented concepts.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, along with sorting and searching algorithms.
- **OOP Concepts**: Exploring classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **Advanced Topics**: Multithreading, collections, and more.
- **Code Examples**: A collection of example programs demonstrating important Java concepts.

## Why This Repository?

The main goal is to practice Java after a break and to consolidate knowledge of Java programming. Feel free to explore, contribute, or offer suggestions!
